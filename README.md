# telo_customer_churn_prediction
Predict which customers are likely to leave a service or subscription, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies and reduce customer attrition.

Dataset:
This project utilizes the Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle, which contains customer demographic details, account information, and service usage metrics.

Project Overview:
The goal is to analyze customer data to identify behavioral and demographic patterns associated with churn. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project builds predictive models that accurately identify at-risk customers, allowing targeted intervention.

Key Features:

Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.

Model Training: Implementation and comparison of models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to predict customer churn.

Model Interpretation: Use of explainability techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to uncover key drivers behind churn predictions and enhance model transparency.

Real-Time Prediction (Optional): Framework considerations for integrating the model into a real-time system to update churn risk scores as new customer data becomes available.

Technologies & Tools:

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM)

Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Model explainability tools (SHAP, LIME)

Outcome:
This project aims to provide actionable insights into customer retention, helping businesses minimize churn by focusing on critical factors influencing customer behavior.
